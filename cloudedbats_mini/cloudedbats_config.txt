### Settings for CloudedBats-mini.

###
### '#' used for comments and for deactivated rows. 
###
### Default setup for the Pettersons M500-384 microphone
### at some random place (lat: 60.00, long: 15.00) in Sweden.
###

### Timezone. Available timezones are listed here: 
### - http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/xtra/tzdatepick.html
#timezone: UTC
timezone: Europe/Stockholm

### Latitude and longitude used in Wave file namnes when no GPS is attached.
### Also used when calculating sunset, sunrise etc.
default_latitude: 60.00
default_longitude: 15.00

### Wave file prefix.
### Wave file will be named this way: <prefix>_<date>_<position>_<type>.wav
wave_file_prefix: CloudedBats

### Directory path for wave files.
#wave_file_dir_path: /home/parallels/Desktop/MINI_TEST # For "Ubuntu on Mac" development.
wave_file_dir_path: /media/usb/cloudedbats_mini

### Each record length. A new file is created after the specified time: 
#record_length_s: 1 # 1 sec.
#record_length_s: 10 # 10 sec.
#record_length_s: 60 # 1 min.
#record_length_s: 120 # 2 min.
#record_length_s: 300 # 5 min.
record_length_s: 600 # 10 min.

### Sound card. A unique part of the device name is enough. Check the log file 
### (cloudedbats_log.txt) for a list of connected cards/sources.
### Note: recording_type, adc_resolution and channels must match the sound card.
sound_card_name: Pettersson
#sound_card_name: iMic # Griffin iMic. 44.1kHz/16bits/stereo. For bat detectors, etc.
#sound_card_name: GoMic # Samson GoMic 44.1kHz/16bits/mono. For audiable sound.

### Recording type. Used for the <type> part in file names. For the TE192-TE500
### alternatives the output sample frequency will be divided by 10 which means that
### a one minute record will be marked as a ten minutes record.
### - MIC: Can be used with external sound cards or USB microphones to 
###   record audiable sound.
### - HET/TD/TE: Can be used for external sound cards. To be used when 
###   recording from a detector in heterodyne, time division or time expansion mode.
### - FSxxx: Full scan. You can't listen to it. 
### - TExxx: Time Expansion. Same file size as FSxxx, but when playing the file it will 
###   be done at slower speed. (Time is multiplied by 10, frequency is divided by 10.) 
#recording_type: MIC # Sound from sound card or USB microphone, 44.1 kHz.
#recording_type: HET # Heterodyne from detector, 44.1 kHz.
#recording_type: TD # Time Division from detector, 44.1 kHz.
#recording_type: TE # Time Expansion from detector, 44.1 kHz.
#recording_type: TE192 # Time expansion from 192 kHz.
#recording_type: TE250 # Time expansion from 250 kHz.
#recording_type: TE300 # Time expansion from 300 kHz.
recording_type: TE384 # Time expansion from 384 kHz.
#recording_type: TE500 # Time expansion from 500 kHz.
#recording_type: FS192 # Full spectrum at 192 kHz.
#recording_type: FS250 # Full spectrum at 250 kHz.
#recording_type: FS300 # Full spectrum at 300 kHz.
#recording_type: FS384 # Full spectrum at 384 kHz.
#recording_type: FS500 # Full spectrum at 500 kHz.

### ADC resolution (only tested on 16 bits).
adc_resolution: 16 # 16 bits.

### Channels (only support for mono and stereo).
channels: MONO # Mono.
# channels: STEREO # Stereo.

###
### Settings for the scheduler.
###

### Should the scheduler be used?
use_scheduler: True
#use_scheduler: False

### Always use GPS time and position for the scheduler?
### GPS values are always prefered by the software, but this option
### will not start the scheduler until GPS found its position.
only_use_gps_time_and_pos: True
#only_use_gps_time_and_pos: False

### Recording will start at (record_start_event + record_start_adjust).
### Valid values are: sunset, dusk, dawn, sunrise and the format "hh:mm".
record_start_event: sunset
#record_start_event: dusk
#record_start_event: dawn
#record_start_event: sunrise
#record_start_event: 00:00
#record_start_event: 01:00
#record_start_event: 20:00
#record_start_event: 21:00
#record_start_event: 22:00
#record_start_event: 23:00

### Adjust start event. Unit: minutes. 
record_start_adjust: -30

### Recording will stop at (record_stop_event + record_stop_adjust).
### Valid values are: sunset, dusk, dawn, sunrise and the format "hh:mm".
#record_stop_event: sunset # Sunset.
#record_stop_event: dusk # Dusk.
record_stop_event: dawn # Dawn.
#record_stop_event: sunrise # Sunrise.

### WiFi may disturb the recorded sound.
wifi_off_during_rec: True
#wifi_off_during_rec: False

### Turn the RPi off when finished to save battery. 
#rpi_shutdown_when_finished: True 
rpi_shutdown_when_finished: False 

###
### CloudedBats-mini control alternatives.
###

### GPIO is about adding switches or buttons to the RPi.
### The mouse alternative is for control via a standard 
### computer mouse. Use a wireless one for remote control.
use_raspberry_pi_gpio: True
use_mouse_for_remote_control: True

### Save the battery when no space left at the memory card.
rpi_shutdown_when_no_space: True
